9.. WAP to show difference between Structure and Union. 
       
A structure and a union are both ways of combining multiple types of information about a single item. The fundamental distinction between the two is the manner in which specific data is stored and accessible. The following table summarises the major distinctions between structure and union:

Structure

Union

To define a structure, we utilise the struct statement

To define a union, we use the union keyword

Every member has their own memory place

A memory location is shared by all data members

A change in the value of one data member has no effect on the structure’s other data members

A change in one data member’s value has an impact on the value of other data members

Multiple members can be initialised at the same time

Only the first member can be initialised at a time

Multiple values of various members can be stored in a structure

For all of its members, a union stores one value at a time

The overall size of a structure is the sum of the sizes of all data members

The biggest data member determines the total size of a union

At any moment, users can access or recover any member

Only one member can be accessed or retrieved at a time
